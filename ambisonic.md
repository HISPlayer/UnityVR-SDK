# Ambisonics Audio

HISPlayer SDK supports Ambisonics audio with ambiX format from first order to 3rd order, and TBE format to capture sound in all directions. 
It supports headset rotation listener, so the ambisonics audio is locked to the game world when users move the headset around. 

## Requirements
#### Unity version
- Supported Unity versions: Unity 6

It’s required to set **AmbisonicAudio** property in MultistreamProperties through Unity editor.
